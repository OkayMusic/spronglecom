    This homepage defines a new standard for the distribution of all future content. It has been decided that the vertical scroll bar is too restrictive, and that the horizontal scrollbar is far superior. Henceforth all content will be displayed horizontally. This facilitates a more natural layout of entirely text-based websites such as this; in this way the inconvinience of being able to read large amounts of text without scrolling is removed, leaving only pure information. Also it slightly reduces the size of the page, by negating the requiremement for new line characters.
